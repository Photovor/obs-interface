Juniata College's Simplified Studio implementation using OBS and OBS-Websockets

http://services2.juniata.edu/cts/simplified-studio/index2.html

We've been working hard over the 2017 summer to create an improved Simplified Studio experience. The space has been completely renovated to create a flexible studio that can appeal to a wider range of uses. Below is a short list of some updates and improvements that have been made.
All new software based off Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)(https://obsproject.com) and Palakis' obs-websocket plugin (https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket)
